# ESP32 Laser Sensor Module Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a laser sensor module with an ESP32 microcontroller to detect the presence of objects. Laser sensors are effective for precise object detection in various applications, including robotics, security systems, and industrial automation.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Laser Sensor Module
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Block diagram


## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Laser Sensor Module to ESP32:**
   - Connect the digital output pin of the laser sensor module to GPIO pin 2 on the ESP32.
   - Ensure proper power and ground connections for the laser sensor module.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 in the `setup()` function.
   - Configure GPIO pin 2 as an input using `pinMode()` to read the laser sensor module's output.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the digital state of the laser sensor using `digitalRead(laserSensorPin)`.
     - If an object is detected (HIGH state), print "Object detected by laser sensor!" to the Serial Monitor.
     - If no object is detected (LOW state), print "No object detected by laser sensor." to the Serial Monitor.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Alignment:** Ensure the laser beam is properly aligned for accurate object detection.
   - **Environmental Factors:** Minimize interference from ambient light sources that may affect sensor readings.
   - **Application Integration:** Customize detection thresholds or responses based on specific project requirements.

## Applications
- **Object Detection:** Detect the presence or absence of objects with precision.
- **Security Systems:** Use in perimeter monitoring or intrusion detection systems.
- **Industrial Automation:** Implement in conveyor systems or robotic applications for object positioning.

## Notes
- **Serial Output:** Monitor real-time sensor readings and adjust sensor placement or sensitivity as necessary.
- **Delay:** Use a small delay (`delay(500)`) between readings to control the frequency of sensor checks.
